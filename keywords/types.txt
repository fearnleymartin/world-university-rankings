Seem to get the best results with type 1 keywords: i.e. a high number of university websites in the results.
The other types of keywords not so good.
Small variations in the keywords can change the results quite a lot (i.e. bachelors vs undergraduate), even though essentially the same thing. I think therefore it is important to be comprehensive in keyword variation and average out
